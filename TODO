type inference for typedefs
infer types of non-typeinst (un-overloaded) fn defs
- constrain non-typeinst fn call arg / return types to their corresponding fn defs
allow more complex typeclasses
allow generalized fn defs inside typeclasses
deal with more complex types (arrays, etc)
deal with object dot-access
